          "briefSummary": "Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a critical cytokine for the survival and function of regulatory T cells (LTreg). This cytokine has a dual role in the immune system. IL-2 stimulates immune responses by acting on the intermediate affinity IL-2R receptor, IL-2Rβγ, expressed by conventional T cells (LTconv) during activation, but also contributes to the inhibition of immune responses via LTreg that express the high affinity receptor IL-2Rαβγ.\n\nThis difference in IL-2 receptor affinity for IL-2 has led to the development of low-dose IL-2 therapy to stimulate LTreg and improve control of excessive inflammation in autoimmune (AID), inflammatory or alloimmune diseases Low-dose IL-2 therapy is being studied in several of these diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, alopecia, HCV (hepatitis C virus)-induced vasculitis, atopic dermatitis and chronic allo-transplantation-related graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n\nSome of these studies have shown an increase in LTreg numbers and an improvement in certain clinical signs.\n\nTo improve LTreg targeting in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases or GVHD, mutated IL-2s (muteins) have been developed with selective LTreg agonist properties.\n\nThese IL-2 muteins are linked to an Fc fragment to increase their half-life. Two IL-2 variants (IL-2Vs)-Fc preferentially stimulate STAT5 phosphorylation in LTregs compared to conventional FoxP3- (LTconv) CD4+ or CD8+ T cells",
          "detailedDescription": "Hypothesis:\n\nIn order to confirm that this differential effect of IL-2 muteins, already established in non-diseased controls, is also observed in patients with autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases or GVHD, a pilot in vitro study should be conducted on a small number of patient's blood samples (5 or 10 depending on the pathology).\n\nObjective :\n\nConduct a multicentre pilot study to confirm the hypothesis that IL-2 muteins preferentially activate the STAT5 pathway in LTreg compared to LTconv in patients with GVHD, acquired bone marrow aplasia, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, vitiligo, alopecia or atopic dermatitis\n\nMethod:\n\nAt the inclusion, patients will have a blood sample collected for in vitro research purposes. Their clinical data will also be collected.\n\nConclusion This trial should provide in vitro proof-of-principle of the efficacy of IL-2 muteins on LTreg and could eventually lead to a therapeutic trial"

          "detailedDescription": "The overall purpose of the first study (Study 1) is to describe the epidemiology of Alopecia areata (AA) and to assess the current level of primary care service utilisation and management patterns associated with patients diagnosed with AA.\n\nThe overall purpose of the second study (study 2) is to assess the prevalence and incidence of mental health conditions (depressive episodes, recurrent depressive disorder and anxiety disorder) in adult patients diagnosed with AA relative to a control population of patients without a diagnosis of AA. In addition, the study will determine both the treatment, 'sick day' and unemployment burden. Treatment burden comprises that of medications and psychological interventions used to treat mental health conditions in adult patients diagnosed with Alopecia areata.\n\nThe overall purpose of the third study (Study 3) is to assess the prevalence and incidence of atopic and autoimmune conditions in adult patients diagnosed with AA relative to a control population of patients without AA.\n\nThe overall purpose of the fourth study (Study 4) is to assess the incidence of common infections in adult patients diagnosed with AA relative to a control population of patients without AA."

Plaquenil is an anti-inflammatory drug approved by the FDA for malaria, lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. It has an effect on T-lymphocyte mediated inflammation, making it a logical choice for a treatment trail for alopecia areata.",
          "detailedDescription": "Alopecia areata is a high prevalence autoimmune disease with significant consequences. Alopecia areata is a tissue restricted autoimmune disease directed at the hair follicle, resulting in hair loss. Patients frequently suffer severe psychiatric consequences. This is especially true of girls and young women who become bald. The incidence of alopecia areata in the USA (Minnesota is 20.2 per 100,000 person-years with a lifetime risk of approximately 1.7%. There is no significant gender difference. The disease is often chronic with a remitting, relapsing course. Although it responds to immunosuppression, generalized immunosuppression has significant morbidity and treatment is frequently frustrating and not successful. New treatment options are essential. With evidence that alopecia areata is a T-lymphocyte mediated autoimmune condition it has become a model system for the study of pathogenesis and treatment of T-cell mediated autoimmunity and as such is a model for a host of additional T-cell mediated autoimmune conditions."

          "briefSummary": "Purpose of the study The purpose of this study is to pilot an adapted Coping Skills Training (CST) intervention for feasibility and preliminary efficacy with a sample of children 8 to 12 years of age and their parents. The participants in this study at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin are dealing with one of three chronic health conditions (Rheumatologic Conditions, Epilepsy,Spina Bifida, and Asthma).\n\nResearch Questions/Study Aims\n\nThe research questions addressed in the full study are:\n\n1. What is the impact of CST on child depression, QOL, health motivation, attitude toward illness, and self-management efficacy?\n2. What is the impact of CST on parent depression, perception of child's quality of life, perception of impact of CHC on family, and family conflict?",
          "detailedDescription": "Many children with chronic health conditions (CHC) are at increased risk for poor adaptation such as psychosocial problems, behavioral disturbances, and decreased quality of life (QOL). Their parents face economic, social and emotional challenges. In addition, management of the CHC and the involvement of the child in that management can severely challenge both child and parent. Effective coping has been shown to moderate the negative impact of CHC. This study is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of adapting a Coping Skills Training (CST) intervention developed for children with diabetes. The CST intervention will be adapted for an integrated sample of school-aged children 8 to 12 years of age with four health conditions (Rheumatologic Conditions, Epilepsy,Spina Bifida, and Asthma). The study will be a randomized clinical trial with a wait-list control group. Each arm will consist of 25 families. CST is a 6-session group intervention based on cognitive behavioral and learning theory. The impact of CST on both outcomes (child: depression, QOL; parent: depression, Child QOL, CHC impact on family) and protective factors (child: health motivation, attitude, self-management efficacy; parent: family conflict) will be measured."

          "briefSummary": "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an important cause of young stroke which could result in major disability. Cohort studies suggested that 17% of young ischemic stroke were accountable by APS (1). Although warfarin has been the mainstay of treatment in APS for the past decades, recurrent thromboembolism occurred up to 10% of warfarinized patients with APS (2, 3). These observations call for an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms secondary to antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Contrary to traditional understanding, recent evidence suggested mechanisms of cerebrovascular ischemia in APS are far more complex than hypercoagulability alone.\n\nIn the proposed cross-sectional study, we aim to determine the prevalence of intracranial stenosis, and to explore the correlations between the neuroimaging findings and the immunological as well as clinical features in patients with APS.\n\nIn the proposed cross-sectional study, we aim to determine the prevalence of intracranial stenosis, and to explore the correlations between the neuroimaging findings and the immunological as well as clinical features in patients with APS.",
          "detailedDescription": "In the proposed cross-sectional study, we aim to determine the prevalence of intracranial stenosis, and to explore the correlations between the neuroimaging findings and the immunological as well as clinical features in patients with APS.\n\nUpon reviewing the clinical and laboratory information in the medical specialist out-patient clinics, electronic patient record and/or through the Clinical Data Analysis And Reporting System (CDARS), investigators shall identify and recruit on-site APS patients who fulfilled the modified Sapporo criteria, currently aged ≥18 years, and receive care from the Prince of Wales Hospital.\n\nInvestigators shall then arrange a study clinic visit for eligible patients. After obtaining an informed consent, patients will be subjected to cognitive assessment (Hong Kong Version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA)), blood pressure, pulse, body mass index measurement, urinalysis, and contrast MRI brain (see imaging assessment below). Demographic data (age, gender, smoking, drinking, ambulatory status), medical comorbidities (concurrent autoimmune diseases and their organ involvement, history of catastrophic APS, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, number and type of previous arterial or venous thromboembolism), laboratory parameters (complete blood count, liver and renal function test, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sediment rate, high sensitive C-reaction protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, neurofilament light chain, titers of autoimmune markers including anti-nuclear antibodies, extractable nuclear antigen antibodies, aPLs, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, etc.), concurrent medications (aspirin, warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants, antihypertensives, statins, steroid, immunosuppressants, etc.). In another ongoing prospective Brain Health Longitudinal study which contained stroke- and dementia free participants (CREC Ref. No: 2018.148), investigators shall identify age- and gender-matched individuals without aPLs as controls. They will be assessed in the same manner as the APS patients."

Determine the kinetics of T- and B-cell immune reconstitution after a combination of timed plasmapheresis, high dose cyclophosphamide and total lymphoid irradiation, and posttransplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine in these patients.\n\nIII. Determine whether this treatment regimen beneficially influences the clinical course of these patients.",

On the fifth day of G-CSF therapy, PBSC are collected. Patients undergo plasmapheresis on days -9 to -7. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -6 to -3 and total lymphoid irradiation on day -1. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Following PBSC reinfusion, patients receive prophylaxis with oral prednisone or methylprednisolone IV on days -1 to 28, antithymocyte globulin IV on days 1-3, and cyclosporine every 12 hours on days 1-60.\n\nPatients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or pure red cell aplasia are followed on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, and 100, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 5 years. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus are followed on days 14, 28, 60, and 100, and then every 6 months. Patients with vasculitis are monitored for abnormal clinical and laboratory parameters characteristic of the individual type of vasculitis."

Photosensitivity is highly prevalent in lupus and has a wide range of clinical presentations. However, photosensitivity is a poorly defined in lupus and its pathogenesis is not well understood. The purpose of this study is to characterize the early clinical and histopathological changes in lupus skin that occur as a response to ultraviolet light."
